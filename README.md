my old anki plugin from 2018 to read marked words from a e-book reader to automatically generate anki flash cards, which I have used to improve my english. No longer maintained 

The motivation behind this project was to automate the automatic creation of flashcards for learning english. eBook readers have the ability to mark words, which are then stored in the database.  The idea of the plugin was to read these words, look up a simple definition in English using a web scrawler and then create flashcards for Anki.  Due to a version update of Anki this plugin does not work anymore.  Porting it also turned out to be non-trivial.  Since this project was very useful for me, I decided to make the source code public.  Maybe you want to rewrite it or use it in another way.
